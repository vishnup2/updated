def preprocess_segmentation_mask(mask):
    """
    Preprocess an image segmentation mask by dividing it into patches, 
    creating a dictionary of class labels for each patch, and generating 
    an attention matrix based on shared classes between patches.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Divides the input mask into 16x16 patches.
    2. Creates a dictionary mapping each patch to its unique class labels.
    3. Generates an attention matrix indicating which patches share class labels.

    Parameters:
    mask (numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor): The input segmentation mask.
        Expected shape is (224, 224, 1), where each element is an integer
        representing the class label for that pixel.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing three elements:
        - patches (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (14, 14, 16, 16) containing
          the 16x16 patches extracted from the input mask.
        - patch_dict (dict): A dictionary where each key is an integer from 0 to 195
          (representing the patch number), and each value is a list of unique
          class labels present in that patch.
        - attention_matrix (torch.Tensor): A binary tensor of shape (196, 196),
          where entry (i, j) is 1 if patches i and j share any common class labels,
          and 0 otherwise.

    Notes:
    - The function automatically detects and uses GPU if available.
    - If the input is a numpy array, it will be converted to a PyTorch tensor.
    - The input mask is expected to have integer values representing class labels.
    - The function assumes a fixed patch size of 16x16 and produces 14x14 patches.
    - The attention matrix considers two patches as "attending" to each other
      if they contain any of the same class labels.

    Example usage:
    >>> mask = torch.randint(0, 20, (224, 224, 1))  # Random mask with 20 classes
    >>> patches, patch_dict, attention_matrix = preprocess_segmentation_mask(mask)
    >>> print(patches.shape)  # Should output: torch.Size([14, 14, 16, 16])
    >>> print(len(patch_dict))  # Should output: 196
    >>> print(attention_matrix.shape)  # Should output: torch.Size([196, 196])
